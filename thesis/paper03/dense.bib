abstract = "We show that series arrays of N identical overdamped Josephson junctions have extremely degenerate dynamics. In particular, we prove that such arrays have N − 3 constants of motion for all N ⩾ 3. The analysis is based on a coordinate transformation that reduces the governing equations to an (N − 3)-parameter family of low-dimensional systems. In the weak-coupling limit, the reduced equations can be analyzed completely. Either all solutions approach the synchronous state or they converge to a continuous family of incoherent oscillations, depending on a certain parameter value. At the transitional value of this parameter, the system becomes completely integrable. Then the phase space is foliated by invariant two-dimensional tori, for any N ⩾ 3. The infinite-N limit of the system is an integro-partial differential equation with rigorously low-dimensional dynamics. It supports solitons in the integrable case, and chaotic waves in the non-integrable case."

	journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the existence of multiple stable fixed point solutions of the homogeneous Kuramoto model. We develop a necessary condition for the existence of stable fixed points for the general network Kuramoto model. This condition is applied to show that for sufficiently dense n-node networks, with node degrees at least 0.9395(n−1), the homogeneous (equal frequencies) model has only one stable fixed point solution over the full space of phase angles in the range −π to π. This is the zero fixed point solution defined by all phase angle differences being zero. This result, together with existing research, proves a conjecture of Verwoerd and Mason (2007 Proc. of the American Control Conf. pp 4613–8) that for the complete network and the homogeneous model, the zero fixed point has a basin of attraction consisting of the entire space minus a set of measure zero. The necessary conditions are also tested to see how close to sufficiency they might be by applying them to a class of regular degree networks studied by Wiley et al (2006 Chaos 16 015103).}

More formally, let G = (V, E) be a connected graph and denotes its adjacency matrix. Let the function be given by This function has a global maximum when θi = θ for all 1 ⩽ i ⩽ n. It is known that if every vertex is connected to at least μ(n − 1) other vertices for μ sufficiently large, then every local maximum is global. Taylor proved this for μ ⩾ 0.9395 and Ling, Xu & Bandeira improved this to μ ⩾ 0.7929. We give a slight improvement to μ ⩾ 0.7889. Townsend, Stillman & Strogatz suggested that the critical value might be μc = 0.75.}

Photometric and cinematographic records indicate that the range of flash coincidence is of the order of {\textpm} 20 msec. This interval is considerably shorter than the minimum eye-lantern response latency and suggests that the Pteroptyx synchrony is regulated by central nervous feedback from preceding activity cycles, as in the human "sense of rhythm," rather than by direct contemporaneous response to the flashes of other individuals. Observations on the development of synchrony among Thai fireflies indoors, the results of experiments on phase-shifting in the American Photinus pyralis and comparisons with synchronization between crickets and between human beings are compatible with the suggestion.},

abstract = {The impressive variety of biological rhythms leaves no doubt that autonomously periodic processes contribute to the coordination of life-processes. The question here raised is, “What modes of temporal organization—if any—could result from weak interactions in a population of innately oscillatory devices (e.g. electronic oscillators, secretory cells, spontaneously active neurons, or individual animals)?” By mathematical analysis, electronic experiments, and digital computer simulation, answers are found as functions of the nature of the periodic processes and the kind of interactions involved. For populations of “generalized relaxation oscillators”, threshold conditions are discovered for mutual synchronization in any of a variety of modes. It is proposed that self-entraining communities of this sort may exist within individual metazoan animals and plants as the basis of the observed diurnal coordination of their physiological process.}
